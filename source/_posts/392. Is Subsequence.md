Easy

Given a string **s** and a string **t**, check if **s** is subsequence of **t**.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both **s** and **t**. **t** is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and **s** is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

**Example 1:**
**s** = `"abc"`, **t** = `"ahbgdc"`

Return `true`.

**Example 2:**
**s** = `"axc"`, **t** = `"ahbgdc"`

Return `false`.

**Follow up:**
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

1. Iterative

   1) index: str.index(str, beg=0, end=len(string)) 找不到会报错

   2) find: str.find(str, beg=0, end=len(string)) 找不到return -1

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s: return True # must match
        if not t: return False # must not match
        
        while(s):
            if not t: return False
            if s[0] in t:
                idx = t.index(s[0])
                t = t[idx+1:] # update the target with rest
                s = s[1:] # update the source with rest
            else:
                return False
        return True
```

但是我代码有不好的地方是，查了两遍在不在（一次 in，一次.index），对速度会有影响

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        pos = 0
        for c in s:
            try:
                tem = t.index(c, pos)
            except:
                return False
            pos = tem + 1
        return True
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        pos = 0
        for c in s:
            temp = t.find(c, pos)
            if temp == -1:
                return False
            else:
                pos = temp + 1
        return True
```



2. Off-shelf

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        t = iter(t)
        return all(c in t for c in s)
```
