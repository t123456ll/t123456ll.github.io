Easy

Given a list of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in `words` that can be built one character at a time by other words in `words`. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

If there is no answer, return the empty string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: 
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: 
Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
```



**Note:**

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.

The length of `words` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

The length of `words[i]` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.

1. always start from brute force:

   可以使用set来加速查找的时间。然后预先排好序（长度从大到小，字典顺序）找到的第一个符合条件的一定就是最优解

```python
class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        wordset = set(words) # speed up find process
        words = sorted(words, key = lambda c: (-len(c), c))
        
        for w in words:
            if all(w[:k] in wordset for k in range(1, len(w))):
                return w
```
