Easy

Suppose we have a class:

```
public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
```

The same instance of `Foo` will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call `first()`, thread B will call `second()`, and thread C will call `third()`. Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that `second()` is executed after `first()`, and `third()` is executed after `second()`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: There are three threads being fired asynchronously. The input [1,2,3] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls second(), and thread C calls third(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,3,2]
Output: "firstsecondthird"
Explanation: The input [1,3,2] means thread A calls first(), thread B calls third(), and thread C calls second(). "firstsecondthird" is the correct output.
```

多线程 multithread: different thread share the same storage, may appears the situation that they address the same global variable at the same time, so we don't know which one is first. and the result may different during different running.





1. using barrier

```python
from threading import Barrier
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.first_barrier = Barrier(2)
        self.second_barrier = Barrier(2)

    def first(self, printFirst: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        # printFirst() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
        printFirst()
        self.first_barrier.wait()


    def second(self, printSecond: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        self.first_barrier.wait()
        # printSecond() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.
        printSecond()
        self.second_barrier.wait()


    def third(self, printThird: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        self.second_barrier.wait()
        # printThird() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
        printThird()
```

2. using locks

```python
from threading import Lock
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locks = (Lock(),Lock())
        self.locks[0].acquire()
        self.locks[1].acquire()

    def first(self, printFirst: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        # printFirst() outputs "first". Do not change or remove this line.
        printFirst()
        self.locks[0].release()      

    def second(self, printSecond: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        with self.locks[0]:
            # printSecond() outputs "second". Do not change or remove this line.
            printSecond()
            self.locks[1].release()
        
    def third(self, printThird: 'Callable[[], None]') -> None:
        with self.locks[1]:
            # printThird() outputs "third". Do not change or remove this line.
            printThird()
```
